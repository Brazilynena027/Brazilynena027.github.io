        <h2>Narratives</h2

             <p>Enhancements One,Two and Three artifact is an Events tracking app that was created in the CS-360 course Mobile Architecture and Programming in Android Studio using Java code. 
                The goal of the application is to track events that are logged by the user to a calendar on the user’s mobile phone. The user can Add, delete or update existing events in SQL Lite database. 
                When the event is approaching its start time an SMS notification will be sent to the user to notify them of the upcoming event as a reminder. 
                This artifact was created in April of 2024. </p>
             <p>I chose this artifact for several reasons. One, when I developed this app, I had not completed it functionality and I thought this would be a great way to showcase my abilities in what I have learned throughout my time at SNHU. 
                Secondly, since it had been some time since this application was created it would allow me to reacquaint myself with the material and IDE and get morehands-on time with this artifact. 
                In Enhancement One, The specific components that showcase my skill and abilities in the Software Design and Engineering portion are within the user interface portion of the application under activity_main_login and activity_register xml files as well as the MainActivityLogin and RegisterActivity file code which is the functionality of the user interfaces for login in a user and signing up a user for a new account. 
                The artifact was improved by adding more visuals to the main login page and sign-up page, such as an icon representing what the page is about. I also implemented a password recovery link and a Remember me check box on the login screen. For the password recovery link, I had to create a new class for forgotpassword to give functionality to the forgot password link on the login screen. 
                I also added code to the MainActivityLogin file for the Remember me check box to add functionality to populate the username and password fields if the box is checked by the user. I decided to keep the footer and header however, I did minor changes to the color of the buttons.</p>
             <p>In Enhancement Two, The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and datastructures are in the Event database, DateUtils class files, and Date_event_controls.xml. In the date_event_controls xml. I rewrote this code because initially there wasn’t much to this page. I implemented a date and time picker to show a calendar and clock for the user to choose the date and time of the event. 
                I added an Edit text field for the title of the event and description, and buttons to submit or cancel the event. The Event Database allows users and events to be added, updated, deleted, and retrieved. For user management, it allows user authentication, registration, and retrieval. For event management, there is data consistency through caching, foreign key constraints and logging errors. I created a DateUtil class to make it easier to handle date logic. 
                This makes sure it is in one place and avoids code being repeated in other parts of my application. Also, the class can be reused in parts where date operations are needed. Overall, it is just a better organization of my code. The artifact was improved by the separation of concerns (ardalis. (n.d.), meaning that I was able to separate the data handling logic. Where the Event database focuses on events and user management, cache and database interactions.
                The cache helps to reduce the database queries by storing regularly accessed data in memory, which improves the performance when retrieving users or events. I also implemented an Event Database Unit test that uses a mock database to test the add event method using Mockito to help ensure that the cache is working an intended. </p>
             <p>In Enhancement Three, The specific components that showcase my skills and abilities are where I use HashMap, which is a form of a hash table. The event Cache is implemented using alinked hash map, which maintains the order of entries for events. Another area that I have concentrated on is security. I implemented SQLCipher, which is used to encrypt the database with an encryption key that keeps the data protected and inaccessible without the key. 
                I also use Optional, which handles null values safely.</p>
             <p>With the inclusion of all three artifacts I have demonstrated that I was able to meet all 5 course outcomes.</p>

      <section id="Reflection">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
           <p>Throughout the enhancement process, I learned the importance of maintaining a strong mindset for error handling. This proved challenging, as I am not deeply experienced in this area, and considering all possible errors requires significant time and careful attention to detail. It’s easy to overlook edge cases, but ensuring comprehensive error handling is crucial for reliable functionality.
              Additionally, when implementing caching, I recognized the need to avoid storing sensitive information to prevent security risks. To address this, I limited caching to event-related data and deliberately excluded user information after realizing its potential security implications. By commenting out the cache for user data, I reinforced a more secure approach.
              Finally, as I developed and refined my code, I had to strike a balance between security measures and performance efficiency. Implementing robust security is essential, but it must not come at the cost of slowing down functionality. Finding this balance required thoughtful decision-making and careful optimization.</p>
